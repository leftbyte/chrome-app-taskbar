This was my first attempt at writing any javascript code, so this app doesn't
adhere to the better javascript patterns/conventions such as:
- module namespacing
- private/protected/public methods
  - this.method vs function.prototype
- consistent use of function declarations and named function expressions.
- caching of for loop end conditional
- private vars prefixed with _
- using object literals for singletons (no constructo function needed)
- cache property lookups: var slice = Array.prototype.slice
